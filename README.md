Aquarius is an iPhone tweak meant to run on jailbroken iPhones running iOS 14.0-14.2

Aquarius aimed to give users more personal choice over how they wanted their iPhone to look, allowing them to edit the appearance of a variety of iOS UI elements such as the lockscreen music player to the appearance of notifications.

Aquarius ultimately gained over 2.6k concurrent users who downloaded it off the [Twickd](https://repo.twickd.com/package/com.twickd.nico-carbone.aquarius) tweak repository.
